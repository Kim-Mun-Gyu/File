	<h2>Explanation</h2>
		<details>
		<summary id='C'>C Programming</summary>
		<img src = 'image/c.PNG' id='float'>-A system programming language developed by 			D.M.Ritchie in 1971 at Bell Labs. It is a convenient language that can write 				programs concisely and easy to program.
		<br>
		-C language is evaluated as a convenient language that is easy to program because it lacks the ability to easily detect program errors, but there are fewer technical 			restrictions that are often found in high-level languages, and it is a language that has done a lot of research to write a program concisely.
		</details>
		<br>
		<details>
		<summary id='P'>Python</summary>
		<img src= 'image/p.PNG' id='float'>-A type of computer language that is concise and 		productive programming language
		<br>-Python has a user base, ranging from beginners to experts, can be used on various platforms, and has abundant libraries (modules), increasing its use in various educational institutions, research institutes and industries, including universities.
		</details>
		<br>
		<details>
		<summary id='C1'>Calculs</summary>
		<img src='image/dif.png' id='float'>-Calculus is a branch of mathematics that deals with extreme, functional, differential, integral and infinite series.
		<br>-Calculus is largely divided into two categories: differential and integral. 		Differentiation is an area that deals with local changes, and integration is an area 		that deals with local amounts of aggregation.
		</details>
		<br>
		<details>
		<summary id = 'S'>Statistics</summary>
		<img src='image/st.png' id='float'>-Statistics, based on arithmetic methods, is a branch of mathematics that mainly studies how to observe, organize and analyze large amounts of data.
		<br>-Statistics use techniques of applied mathematics to find numerical properties, 	regularity, or irregularity from data that can be obtained by observation and investigation. Statistical techniques are studies that provide the basis for conducting experimental planning, summaries or interpretations of data, and are applied in a wide range of fields and applied to real life.
